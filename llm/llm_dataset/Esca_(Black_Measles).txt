Esca, also known as Black Measles, is a complex grapevine disease caused by a group of fungal pathogens, including Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium aleophilum. It primarily affects the wood of grapevines but also causes visible damage to the leaves and fruit. Esca can weaken vines, reduce fruit quality, and in severe cases, kill the plant.

What It Looks Like:
On Leaves:

The most characteristic symptom is the appearance of interveinal chlorosis, where the tissue between leaf veins turns yellow or red, depending on the grape variety.
This chlorosis is often followed by necrotic, dark brown spots, giving the leaf a "tiger stripe" or "measles" appearance.
As the disease progresses, leaves may become brittle and dry, eventually falling off the vine.
On Fruit (Berries):

Grapes may exhibit dark, sunken spots, and shrivel prematurely, resulting in reduced fruit quality.
Infected berries may develop a wrinkled, leathery texture and can sometimes ooze dark liquid.
On Stems and Trunk:

Internally, the wood of affected vines may show dark streaks, indicating the presence of the fungus. In advanced stages, this can lead to vine decline or sudden death.
How It Spreads:
Fungal Spores in Pruning Wounds:

The fungi responsible for Esca enter the grapevine through pruning wounds, particularly in older vines.
Contaminated Tools and Equipment:

The disease can spread through contaminated pruning tools or other equipment that comes into contact with infected vines.
Soil and Water Movement:

The fungal pathogens can be spread through soil and water, affecting nearby vines.
How to Control and Treat It:
Remove Infected Plant Parts:

Prune out and destroy infected vines, shoots, and wood to reduce the fungal load in the vineyard.
If only part of a vine is affected, remove the symptomatic portion to prevent the disease from spreading further.
Sanitize Pruning Tools:

Sterilize pruning tools between cuts to avoid transmitting the fungi from infected vines to healthy ones.
Disinfect tools using bleach or alcohol-based solutions to kill fungal spores.
Minimize Pruning Wounds:

Avoid excessive pruning, especially in wet or humid conditions, as pruning wounds provide entry points for the fungi.
Seal Pruning Wounds:

Apply fungicidal wound protectants to pruning cuts to prevent fungal infections.
Improve Vineyard Conditions:

Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering, as excessive moisture can promote fungal growth.
Maintain proper spacing between vines to promote good air circulation and reduce humidity levels.
Preventative Fungicide Use:

Apply fungicides during periods of high disease pressure, especially after pruning or during humid weather. Fungicides are more effective when applied early to prevent infection.
However, fungicides may not always be fully effective against Esca, and their use is typically preventative rather than curative.
Prevention Tips:
Avoid Planting in Wet Areas: Ensure your vineyard is planted in well-drained soils to reduce the likelihood of fungal buildup.
Monitor Vine Age: Older vines are more susceptible to Esca. If possible, replant with younger, healthier vines in affected areas.
Practice Good Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant parts and keep the vineyard clean to minimize the spread of the disease.
Managing Esca:
Annual Monitoring: Regularly inspect vines for symptoms of Esca, especially in older vines. Early detection can help manage the disease and slow its spread.
Replanting: Severely affected vines may need to be removed and replaced, as Esca can be difficult to fully control once established.
