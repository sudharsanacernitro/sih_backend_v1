Improving apple quality involves several key practices:

    Proper Soil Management:
        Use well-draining soil with balanced nutrients.
        Conduct soil tests and amend as needed.

    Optimal Watering:
        Ensure consistent watering, especially during dry spells.
        Avoid waterlogging; use drip irrigation if possible.

    Pruning and Thinning:
        Prune trees to remove dead or diseased branches and to improve air circulation.
        Thin fruit to prevent overcrowding and enhance fruit size and quality.

    Pest and Disease Control:
        Regularly inspect for pests and diseases.
        Use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques and organic pesticides if necessary.

    Fertilization:
        Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil nutrient levels and tree needs.

    Harvest Timing:
        Harvest apples at the right maturity for optimal flavor and texture.

    Post-Harvest Handling:
        Store apples in cool, humid conditions to extend shelf life and maintain quality.
