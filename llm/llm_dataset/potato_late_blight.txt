Potato Late Blight is a devastating fungal-like disease caused by Phytophthora infestans. It was the primary cause of the Irish Potato Famine and continues to be a major problem in potato-growing regions. The disease thrives in cool, wet conditions and can rapidly destroy entire crops if not managed properly.
What It Looks Like:

    On Leaves:
        Dark, water-soaked spots appear on the leaves, usually starting at the edges or tips.
        These spots quickly enlarge and turn brown or black, often with a yellow border.
        In humid conditions, a white, fuzzy growth (spores) may appear on the undersides of the leaves.
        Infected leaves eventually shrivel and die, leading to defoliation.

    On Stems:
        Dark brown to black lesions form on the stems, causing them to collapse and die.
        The entire plant can wilt and die within a few days of infection.

    On Tubers (Potatoes):
        Dark, irregular, and firm spots appear on the tuber surface.
        The infection can spread inside the tuber, leading to brownish-red rot that can cause the potato to become soft and mushy.

How It Spreads:

    The pathogen survives in infected tubers left in the field, on cull piles, or in volunteer plants.
    Spores are spread by wind, rain, and irrigation, especially during cool, wet weather.
    The disease can develop rapidly, with symptoms appearing just a few days after infection.

How to Control and Treat It:

    Use Certified Disease-Free Seed Potatoes:
        Start Clean: Always plant certified, disease-free seed potatoes to reduce the initial risk of late blight.

    Practice Crop Rotation:
        Rotate Crops: Avoid planting potatoes in the same area for consecutive years. Rotate with non-host crops (such as cereals or legumes) for 3-4 years.

    Destroy Infected Plant Material:
        Remove Infected Plants: Promptly remove and destroy any plants showing symptoms of late blight.
        Dispose Properly: Do not compost infected plants; instead, burn or bury them deep in the soil to prevent the spread of the pathogen.

    Ensure Proper Plant Spacing and Air Circulation:
        Space Plants Adequately: Plant potatoes with enough space between them to allow good air circulation, which helps keep foliage dry and reduces the risk of infection.

    Use Mulch:
        Mulch the Soil: Apply mulch to reduce soil splashing onto the plants, which can help prevent the spread of spores from the soil to the foliage.
