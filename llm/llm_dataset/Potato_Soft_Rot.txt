Potato Soft Rot is a bacterial disease caused by Pectobacterium and Dickeya species. It typically affects harvested and stored potatoes, leading to rapid decay. This disease thrives in warm, moist conditions and can quickly destroy affected tubers, causing significant post-harvest losses.

What It Looks Like:
On Tubers (Potatoes):
Soft, water-soaked lesions on the surface of the potato, often starting around wounds or bruises.
The infected area becomes mushy and may emit a foul odor as the potato decays.
The skin over the affected area may remain intact initially, but the flesh underneath becomes soft and slimy.
In advanced stages, the entire potato can become liquefied, turning into a foul-smelling, rotting mass.
No clear boundary between healthy and infected tissue as the rot spreads quickly.
How It Spreads:
Through Wounds and Cuts:

Soft rot bacteria enter through wounds, cuts, or bruises caused by mechanical damage during harvest, handling, or storage.
Tubers with damaged or weakened skins are highly susceptible to infection.
Moisture and Temperature:

Soft rot thrives in high-moisture environments, especially when combined with warm temperatures (above 68°F/20°C).
Waterlogged soil, improper storage conditions, and humid storage environments favor the spread of the bacteria.
Contaminated Water and Soil:

Irrigating fields with contaminated water or planting potatoes in contaminated soil can introduce the bacteria.
Once soft rot infects a tuber, it can easily spread to other tubers in storage, especially if moisture is present.
How to Control and Treat It:
Handle Potatoes Carefully:

Minimize bruising and wounding during harvesting and handling to prevent bacteria from entering the tubers.
Harvest during dry conditions when the soil is not too wet to reduce the risk of injury and bacterial infection.
Cure Tubers Before Storage:

After harvest, cure potatoes in a warm, dry environment (around 50–60°F or 10–15°C) with good ventilation for 1-2 weeks to allow any wounds to heal.
This toughens the skin and helps reduce the chances of soft rot infection.
Store in Proper Conditions:

Temperature Control: Store potatoes in a cool, well-ventilated environment at 40–45°F (4–7°C) to slow down bacterial growth.
Humidity Control: Keep the storage area dry, with relative humidity around 85–90%, to prevent moisture accumulation that can promote rot.
Ventilation: Ensure good airflow to reduce humidity and moisture in the storage area.
Use Clean Water and Sanitize Equipment:

Avoid irrigating with contaminated water and ensure all harvesting, washing, and storage equipment is properly cleaned and sanitized to prevent bacterial spread.
Inspect and Remove Infected Tubers:

Regularly inspect stored potatoes and remove any showing signs of soft rot to prevent further spread.
Use Disease-Free Seed Potatoes:

Plant only certified, disease-free seed potatoes to reduce the risk of introducing the bacteria into your field or storage.
Prevention Tips:
Avoid Excessive Moisture: Both in the field and in storage, keeping moisture levels low is critical to preventing soft rot.
Careful Harvesting and Storage: Prevent mechanical damage to tubers and ensure proper curing and storage conditions to reduce the chances of infection.
Monitor for Early Signs: Catching soft rot early by regularly checking stored potatoes can help prevent widespread damage.
