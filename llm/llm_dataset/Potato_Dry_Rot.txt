Potato Dry Rot is a common fungal disease caused by species of the fungus Fusarium. It primarily affects stored potatoes, leading to shriveled, dry, and decayed tubers. This disease can result in significant post-harvest losses and is often linked to improper handling and storage conditions.

What It Looks Like:
On Tubers (Potatoes):

Dark, sunken lesions or patches that start small but can enlarge over time.
The decayed area becomes dry, with a wrinkled, shrunken appearance.
When cut, the affected tissue is dry and crumbly, often showing brown, black, or grey rot.
In advanced stages, the entire potato may shrivel and hollow out.
White, pink, or purple fungal growth may be visible on the surface of the lesions.
On Plants (Before Harvest):

Dry rot can affect emerging potato sprouts, causing them to rot and preventing the plant from growing properly.
If infected tubers are planted, the disease may spread to the new crop, leading to poor or stunted growth.
How It Spreads:
Through Wounds and Cuts:

The fungus enters the potato through wounds, bruises, or cuts made during harvesting, handling, or storage.
Damage caused by mechanical equipment during harvest or improper handling significantly increases the risk of infection.
During Storage:

Once in storage, the fungus can spread from infected tubers to healthy ones, especially if conditions are favorable for fungal growth (high humidity and temperature fluctuations).
Infected Seed Tubers:

Planting infected seed potatoes can lead to early infections in the growing season, which can impact the health of the emerging plants and reduce yield.
How to Control and Treat It:
Handle Potatoes Gently:

Minimize damage during harvesting and handling to reduce the entry points for the fungus.
Ensure that harvesting is done when the soil is neither too wet nor too dry to prevent excessive bruising.
Cure Tubers Before Storage:

Cure freshly harvested potatoes for 1-2 weeks in a warm, dry area to allow cuts and wounds to heal before storage.
Curing helps toughen the skin, reducing the chance of fungal infection.
Store in Proper Conditions:

Temperature Control: Store potatoes at cool, stable temperatures (38–40°F or 3–4°C) to slow down fungal growth.
Humidity Control: Maintain a low-humidity environment in storage (90–95%) to prevent the spread of dry rot.
Ventilation: Ensure proper airflow in storage facilities to keep moisture levels in check.
Use Fungicides:

Applying fungicides to seed potatoes before planting can help prevent dry rot from affecting the new crop.
Treatment with fungicides after harvest may help in reducing the spread of dry rot in storage, though this should be used as a last resort.
Inspect and Remove Infected Tubers:

Regularly inspect stored potatoes for signs of dry rot and promptly remove any infected tubers to prevent the disease from spreading.
Use Disease-Free Seed Potatoes:

Always plant certified, disease-free seed potatoes to reduce the risk of introducing the fungus into the field or storage.
Prevention Tips:
Avoid Mechanical Injury: Careful handling during harvesting, transport, and storage is the best way to prevent dry rot infections.
Proper Storage: Ensure that storage conditions are optimal, with low humidity, good ventilation, and stable temperatures.
Use Resistant Varieties: Consider planting potato varieties that show resistance to dry rot, which can reduce the disease's impact.
