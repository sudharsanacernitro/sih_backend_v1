    Soil Preparation:
        Use well-drained, loamy soil with good organic matter.
        Ensure soil pH is between 5.5 and 6.5.

    Planting:
        Choose high-quality seed potatoes free from diseases.
        Space potatoes properly to avoid overcrowding.

    Watering:
        Maintain consistent moisture, especially during tuber formation.
        Avoid waterlogging; use drip irrigation if necessary.

    Fertilization:
        Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil tests.
        Use a higher phosphorus and potassium fertilizer during tuber development.

    Pest and Disease Control:
        Regularly check for pests like aphids and beetles.
        Monitor for diseases such as blight and take appropriate measures.

    Weed and Weed Management:
        Control weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

    Harvesting:
        Harvest potatoes when plants start to die back.
        Cure harvested potatoes in a cool, dark place to improve storage quality.

    Storage:
        Store potatoes in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area.
        Avoid storing potatoes near fruits that produce ethylene gas.
