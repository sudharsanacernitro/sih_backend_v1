Blackspot Bruising is a common issue in potatoes, leading to internal damage that appears as dark spots beneath the skin. These spots are caused by mechanical injury, such as dropping or rough handling of the potatoes. Here's how you can identify, prevent, and treat blackspot bruising:

What It Looks Like:
On Potatoes (Tuber):
Dark, irregular spots beneath the skin that do not break the surface.
The bruising becomes more noticeable after cutting the potato, revealing a dark grey or black area under the skin.
The external appearance of the potato may not always show damage, making it hard to detect without cutting the tuber.
How It Spreads:
Physical Damage:
The bruising occurs when potatoes are handled roughly, especially during harvesting, packing, and transport.
Potatoes with low moisture content or stored at low temperatures are more susceptible to bruising.
How to Control and Treat It:
Handle Potatoes Gently:

During Harvesting: Use care when digging and handling potatoes to avoid drops or impacts that can cause bruising.
In Storage and Transport: Minimize the height from which potatoes are dropped, and use cushioned surfaces to prevent mechanical injury.
Maintain Proper Moisture and Temperature:

Store at Correct Temperature: Keep potatoes at moderate temperatures (45–50°F or 7–10°C). Storing at colder temperatures can make potatoes more prone to bruising.
Ensure Proper Moisture Levels: Potatoes with higher moisture content are less likely to bruise, so aim for optimal storage humidity.
Harvest at the Right Time:

Cure Before Storage: Allow freshly harvested potatoes to cure for 1-2 weeks before storing them. This helps toughen the skin, reducing the risk of bruising during storage.
Avoid Harvesting in Wet or Cold Conditions: Wet soil increases the chances of mechanical damage, while cold temperatures make potatoes more fragile.
Monitor and Inspect Regularly:

Check for Bruising: Regularly inspect stored potatoes for signs of blackspot bruising and separate any affected tubers to prevent further damage.
