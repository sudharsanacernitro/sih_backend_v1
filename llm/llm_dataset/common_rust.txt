Common Rust in corn is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. It is a widespread disease that affects corn leaves, reducing photosynthesis and, in severe cases, impacting yield. The disease is most prevalent in cool, moist conditions and can spread rapidly under favorable weather.

What It Looks Like:
On Leaves:

Small, raised, reddish-brown pustules (spore-producing structures) appear on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.
These pustules may form in rows or scattered across the leaf surface.
As the disease progresses, the pustules turn darker, and the surrounding leaf tissue may become yellow.
Severely infected leaves can dry out and die prematurely, reducing the plant's photosynthetic capacity.
On Stalks (Rarely):

Pustules may occasionally form on stalks and husks, though this is less common than on the leaves.
How It Spreads:
Wind-Blown Spores:

The fungus produces spores that are carried long distances by the wind. These spores land on corn leaves, germinate, and cause new infections under favorable conditions.
Cool, Moist Conditions:

Common rust thrives in cool temperatures (60–75°F or 15–24°C) and high humidity.
Extended periods of leaf wetness, such as from rain or dew, promote the spread of the disease.
Overwintering in Tropical Areas:

The fungus does not survive the winter in colder climates but overwinters in southern or tropical regions. Spores are blown northward to infect new crops each year.
How to Control and Treat It:
Use Resistant Hybrids:

Plant corn hybrids that are resistant to common rust. Many modern corn hybrids have built-in resistance that can effectively prevent significant infection.
Choose hybrids appropriate for your region and environmental conditions to reduce susceptibility.
Fungicide Applications:

Apply fungicides if conditions are conducive to disease development and rust is detected early.
Fungicides containing strobilurins or triazoles can be effective at controlling common rust, especially if applied at the first signs of infection.
Monitor disease progression and weather patterns to determine the necessity of fungicide application.
Improve Airflow and Drying:

Plant corn with proper spacing to allow good air circulation through the crop canopy, which helps leaves dry faster and reduces the risk of infection.
Crop Rotation:

Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like soybeans or wheat to reduce the presence of fungal spores in the field.
Prevention Tips:
Plant Resistant Varieties: This is the most effective way to prevent common rust from affecting your crop.
Monitor Weather and Field Conditions: Keep an eye on conditions that favor rust development, especially cool, moist weather.
Timely Fungicide Application: Apply fungicides at the early stages of infection to prevent the disease from spreading further.
