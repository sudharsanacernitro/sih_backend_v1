Apple Scab is a common fungal disease that affects apple trees, causing dark, scabby spots on leaves and fruit. Here's how you can identify, prevent, and treat it:
What It Looks Like:

    On Apples (Fruit): Small, dark, and rough spots or scabs that can grow larger, making the fruit look cracked and ugly.
    On Leaves: Olive-green to brown spots that might turn velvety or have a scabby texture. Infected leaves may curl up and fall off early.

How It Spreads:

    The fungus survives in fallen leaves over the winter.
    In the spring, spores are released from these leaves, especially in cool and wet weather, and spread to new leaves and fruit.

How to Control and Treat It:

    Clean Up Fallen Leaves:
        Rake and Destroy Leaves: Regularly rake up and destroy fallen leaves, especially in the fall, to reduce the source of infection for the next season.
        Composting Carefully: If you compost, make sure the pile gets hot enough to kill the fungus.

    Use Fungicides:
        Preventative Sprays: Start spraying fungicides early in the spring when new leaves begin to appear. Continue as needed, especially during wet weather.
        Common Fungicides: Captan, Myclobutanil, or Mancozeb are often used to control apple scab.

    Prune and Space Your Trees:
        Improve Airflow: Prune your trees to allow better airflow, which helps the leaves dry out faster and reduces the chances of infection.
        Proper Spacing: Plant trees with enough space between them so that they donâ€™t stay damp for too long after rain.

    Choose Resistant Varieties:
        Plant Scab-Resistant Apples: Some apple varieties are bred to resist scab. Look for these when planting new trees to reduce the risk of disease.

    Monitor Regularly:
        Check Your Trees: Keep an eye on your trees, especially after wet weather, to catch early signs of scab. Early treatment can prevent it from spreading.
