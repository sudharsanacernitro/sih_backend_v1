Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) in corn is caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum. It is a common disease in many corn-growing regions, particularly where cool, wet conditions persist. If not managed, it can lead to significant yield losses by reducing photosynthesis and weakening the plant.

What It Looks Like:
On Leaves:
The most distinctive symptom is the presence of long, elliptical, gray-green to tan lesions (often 1 to 6 inches long) on the leaves.
The lesions tend to run parallel with the leaf veins, creating a "cigar-shaped" appearance.
As the disease progresses, lesions may merge, causing large sections of the leaves to die.
Severe infections can cause the entire leaf to turn brown and dry out, reducing the plant’s photosynthetic capacity.
On Other Plant Parts:
In some cases, lesions may appear on the husks of the corn, though the primary target is the leaves.
How It Spreads:
Through Infected Crop Residue:
The fungus survives in crop residues left in the field after harvest, producing spores that can infect the next season’s crop.
Wind and Rain:
Spores are dispersed by wind and rain splash, landing on healthy corn plants and infecting them under the right conditions.
Cool, Humid Conditions:
Northern Leaf Blight is favored by moderate to cool temperatures (64-81°F or 18-27°C) and prolonged periods of leaf wetness, such as during heavy dews, rain, or irrigation.
How to Control and Treat It:
Use Resistant Hybrids:

Plant corn hybrids with resistance to Northern Leaf Blight. Many hybrids are available with genetic resistance that can prevent or minimize infections.
Some hybrids may be partially resistant, providing protection even in high-risk conditions.
Fungicide Applications:

Fungicides can be effective when applied early, especially at the VT (tasseling) to R1 (silking) stages if disease pressure is high.
Common fungicides for controlling Northern Leaf Blight include those containing strobilurins or triazoles.
Fungicide application is most effective when applied before disease symptoms become widespread.
Crop Rotation:

Rotating corn with non-host crops like soybeans or wheat can reduce the amount of fungal inoculum in the field.
Tillage Practices:

Tillage can help by burying infected crop residues, reducing the source of infection for future crops.
In no-till or reduced-till systems, crop residue may harbor the fungus, so crop rotation and resistant hybrids become even more important.
Maintain Good Airflow:

Avoid overly dense planting and ensure proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation and help leaves dry faster, reducing the chances of infection.
Prevention Tips:
Plant Resistant Varieties: This is one of the most effective ways to manage Northern Leaf Blight.
Monitor Field Conditions: Keep a close watch for disease symptoms, especially during cool, wet weather, to detect early infections.
Proper Fungicide Timing: Apply fungicides based on disease risk and the growth stage of the plant.
