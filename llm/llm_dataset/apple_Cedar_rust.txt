Cedar Apple Rust is a fungal disease that affects apple trees and cedar trees, causing orange spots on leaves and fruit. The fungus requires both apple and cedar trees to complete its life cycle. Here's how you can identify, prevent, and treat it:
What It Looks Like:

    On Apples (Leaves):
        Bright orange or yellow spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves in spring.
        As the season progresses, tiny, tube-like structures called "spore horns" may appear on the undersides of the leaves.
        Severe infections can cause leaves to curl and drop prematurely.

    On Apples (Fruit):
        Similar orange spots may develop on the fruit, often leading to deformed or cracked apples.

    On Cedar Trees:
        The fungus forms reddish-brown galls (swellings) on the branches. In the spring, these galls produce bright orange, jelly-like tendrils.

How It Spreads:

    The fungus spends part of its life on apple trees and part on cedar trees (or junipers).
    Spores from infected apple leaves travel to nearby cedar trees, where they cause galls to form.
    In the spring, these galls release spores that travel back to apple trees, continuing the cycle.

How to Control and Treat It:

    Remove Nearby Cedar Trees:
        Eliminate Cedar Hosts: If possible, remove cedar trees or junipers within a 2-mile radius of your apple trees to break the disease cycle.
        Prune Out Galls: If removing the trees isnâ€™t possible, prune out the galls from cedar trees in late winter before they release spores in the spring.

    Use Fungicides on Apple Trees:
        Preventative Sprays: Apply fungicides to apple trees starting in early spring, just before or as soon as the orange spots appear.
        Continue Treatment: Keep spraying every 7-10 days until about a month after bloom to protect the leaves and fruit.
        Common Fungicides: Myclobutanil and Mancozeb are effective against cedar apple rust.

    Choose Resistant Varieties:
        Plant Resistant Apples: Some apple varieties are less susceptible to cedar apple rust. Consider planting these varieties if the disease is common in your area.

    Improve Tree Health:
        Water and Fertilize: Keep your apple trees healthy by watering during dry periods and applying balanced fertilizer.
        Prune Properly: Prune your apple trees to improve air circulation, which helps leaves dry quickly after rain.

    Regular Monitoring:
        Inspect Frequently: Regularly check your apple trees, especially in early spring, for the first signs of infection. Early detection allows for more effective treatment.
