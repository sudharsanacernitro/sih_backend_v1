Potato Brown Rot, also known as Bacterial Wilt, is a serious bacterial disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. It affects the vascular system of potato plants, leading to wilting and death. This disease is particularly destructive in warm, moist conditions and can result in significant yield loss.

What It Looks Like:
On Tubers (Potatoes):

Discolored, brownish areas in the vascular ring (inside the potato).
Oozing of milky-white or yellowish liquid when the potato is cut, especially near the stem end.
Hollow or water-soaked areas within the potato.
External symptoms may include dark patches on the skin and cracking, but the internal brown rot is a more distinct sign.
On Plants:

Sudden wilting of leaves, usually starting with the lower leaves and progressing upward.
Yellowing of the leaves, especially near the edges, followed by browning.
Infected plants may collapse entirely as the disease progresses.
Bacterial ooze can sometimes be seen when the stem is cut, indicating infection.
How It Spreads:
Soil and Water Transmission:

The bacterium survives in the soil and can infect potatoes through the roots, especially in warm, humid conditions.
Contaminated water, such as irrigation water, can also spread the disease to healthy plants.
Infected Seed Potatoes:

Planting infected or contaminated seed potatoes is a major source of brown rot spread.
Contaminated Equipment:

Machinery, tools, and equipment used in infected fields can transfer the bacteria to other fields.
Environmental Factors:

The disease thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, where temperatures are high (above 75°F/24°C) and soil moisture is high.
How to Control and Treat It:
Use Disease-Free Seed Potatoes:

Always use certified, disease-free seed potatoes to prevent introducing brown rot into your crop.
Practice Crop Rotation:

Rotate potatoes with non-host crops like cereals for at least 2-3 years to reduce bacterial buildup in the soil.
Avoid planting susceptible crops (like tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers) in rotation with potatoes.
Control Water Sources:

Use clean, uncontaminated water for irrigation, and avoid waterlogging as it can promote the spread of the disease.
Ensure good drainage in potato fields to prevent water accumulation.
Sanitize Equipment:

Clean and disinfect all tools, equipment, and machinery before moving between fields to avoid spreading the bacterium.
Remove Infected Plants:

Uproot and destroy infected plants as soon as symptoms are observed to reduce further spread.
Avoid leaving infected plant debris in the field, as the bacterium can survive in soil and plant residues.
Soil Fumigation:

In severely infected fields, soil fumigation may be required to reduce bacterial levels, although this is an expensive and temporary solution.
Monitor and Test Soil:

Regularly test soil for the presence of Ralstonia solanacearum, especially if the disease has been present in previous seasons.
Prevention Tips:
Early detection and proper management are crucial for controlling brown rot, as once the disease is established, it is difficult to eradicate.
Practicing good field hygiene, crop rotation, and using disease-free planting material are key measures to prevent the spread of potato brown rot.
