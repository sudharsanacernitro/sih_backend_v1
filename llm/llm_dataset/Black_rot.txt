Black Rot is a destructive fungal disease of grapes caused by Guignardia bidwellii. It primarily affects the leaves, fruit, and stems, leading to significant yield losses if not managed. The disease thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly under favorable weather.

What It Looks Like:
On Leaves:

Small, circular, tan spots (lesions) form on the leaves, often surrounded by dark brown or black margins.
As the spots enlarge, the centers may turn brown, dry out, and become brittle, while the dark borders expand.
These lesions can eventually cause the leaf tissue to fall out, giving the leaves a "shot-hole" appearance.
In severe cases, the entire leaf may become necrotic and drop prematurely.
On Fruit (Berries):

Initially, small, brownish spots appear on the fruit, which eventually grow, causing the berries to shrivel and turn black.
The infected fruit may become hard and mummified, clinging to the vine as a source of future infection.
On Stems and Shoots:

Dark, elongated lesions can appear on stems and shoots, leading to wilting and dieback if the infection spreads.
How It Spreads:
Overwintering in Debris:
The fungus survives the winter in mummified berries, infected leaves, and other plant debris left on the ground or in the vine.
Rain-Splashed Spores:
During spring and summer, rain splashes spores from infected debris onto new leaves and shoots, initiating new infections.
Warm, Humid Weather:
Black rot thrives in warm, wet conditions (75–85°F or 24–29°C) and can spread rapidly during periods of high humidity and frequent rainfall.
How to Control and Treat It:
Remove and Destroy Infected Plant Debris:

Prune and remove any infected leaves, fruit, and stems during the growing season to reduce sources of infection.
After the growing season, clean up fallen leaves, mummified berries, and any other infected debris from the vineyard floor.
Fungicide Applications:

Apply fungicides at the appropriate growth stages, especially during periods of wet weather when the disease is most likely to spread.
Common fungicides used to control black rot include Captan, Mancozeb, and Myclobutanil.
Fungicides should be applied starting in early spring when the shoots are 4 to 6 inches long, and continue throughout the season if conditions remain favorable for disease.
Proper Pruning and Vineyard Management:

Prune the vines to allow better air circulation through the canopy, helping leaves dry more quickly after rain or dew, reducing infection risk.
Plant Resistant Grape Varieties:

Consider planting grape varieties that show resistance to black rot, especially if you live in a region with frequent warm, humid conditions.
Use Crop Rotation and Avoid Dense Planting:

Ensure that vines are spaced properly to avoid excessive moisture buildup and reduce the chances of fungal infections.
Prevention Tips:
Sanitation is Key: Regularly remove mummified berries and infected plant material to minimize the spread of black rot.
Timely Fungicide Use: Apply fungicides early and throughout the season as a preventative measure, particularly during wet periods.
Promote Airflow: Prune and space vines to improve airflow, which helps leaves dry faster and reduces disease risk.
